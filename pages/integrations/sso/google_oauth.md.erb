# SSO with Google G Suite (OAuth)

Google's G Suite (previously Google Apps) can be used as an SSO provider for your Buildkite organization. To complete this tutorial, you will need admin privileges for Buildkite.

### Step 1. Email Buildkite Support 

Send an email to support@buildkite.com with the following information:

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Domain name</td>
            <td>
              The domain you use with Google G Suite for which you want to enable OAuth. This must match one of the emails you have verified with your Buildkite account.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Organization slug</td>
            <td>
              The Buildkite organization for which you want to enable OAuth.  
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

When we receive your email, Buildkite support will set up SSO in test mode and reply with instructions for performing a test login.

### Step 2. Perform a Test Login

Follow the instructions sent by Buildkite support to perform a test login. Performing a test login will verify that SSO is working correctly, before it is activated for all your organization members.

### Step 3. Buildkite Support will Activate SSO

Once you've performed a test login, reply to the previous email and Buildkite support will activate SSO via Google for your entire Buildkite organization. Activating SSO will log out all of your organizationâ€™s members, to ensure that all data access is authorized through Google.
