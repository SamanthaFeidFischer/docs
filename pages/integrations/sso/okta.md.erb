Okta can be used as an SSO provider for your Buildkite organization. To complete this tutorial, you will need admin privileges for both Okta and Buildkite.

### Step 1. Add Buildkite in Okta

Log into your Okta account, and follow these steps:

### Step 2. Email Buildkite Support

When we receive your email from the previous step, Buildkite support will set up SSO in test mode and reply with instructions for performing a test login.

### Step 3. Perform a Test Login

Follow the instructions sent by Buildkite support to perform a test login. Performing a test login will verify that SSO is working correctly, before it is activated for all your organization members.

### Step 4. Buildkite Support will Activate SSO

Once you've performed a test login, reply to the previous email and Buildkite support will activate SSO via Okta for your entire Buildkite organization. Activating SSO will log out all of your organizationâ€™s members, to ensure that all data access is authorized through Okta.
